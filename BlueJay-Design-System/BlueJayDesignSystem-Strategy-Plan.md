# The BlueJay Design System Strategy

*Overview*

The BlueJay Design System (BJDS) is a unified design and development system for designers and developers who want to extend the O3DE editor. BJDS consists of a design library of reusable components for tools, and pattern guidelines that are the single source of truth for O3DE.

*The BlueJay design philosophy*

O3DE follows the golden rule of design systems: 
*“Systems solve the easy problems so products can solve hard problems more easily.” – Nathan Curtis. (https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/principles-of-designing-systems-294ee45dcf81)*

This approach allows our customers to focus on solving new and novel problems, instead of reinventing the wheel. BJDS unifies the editor to one common experience that is easy to learn and master regardless of discipline. By offering clear and consistent guidelines, it helps content creators and developers create new workflows and extend the editor for new components over time.

*BJDS tenets:*

* *Efficiency* in user interactions and workflows*.*
* *Accessibility* first*.* Accessibility options, such as color contrasts, fonts and icon legibility, interactions and scalability etc. are built into our the tool from the first step.
* *Familiar patterns* for visual interfaces, tools, branding, and UI elements. Don’t reinvent the wheel and confuse users.
* *Modularity* is key to each element of O3DE, including the interface design*.*
