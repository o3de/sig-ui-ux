# O3DE UI/UX Office Hours

This Office Hours provide assistance for user research, user experience design, user interface design, and visual design on O3DE related projects. 

**You can use office hours to:**

* Request a "sign-off" on your project from the UI/UX SIG
* Quick usability/CX review of your designs/mock-ups
* Quick consultation for your product from the customer-centered perspective
* Content review of the feature you are implementing
* Not sure if you need UI/UX office hours? Feel free to [reach out to UI/UX SIG on Discord](https://discord.gg/tvYZUKJK)! 
    * It’s better to have the chance to **power up your project* you’re working on, than skip the opportunity to**.
    * UI/UX SIG can normally be involved during start, middle, and end of projects


**What to bring to the office hour:**

* A brief project overview or TDD document. A simple problem statement or project description will work too.
* Who are the users your project is designed for? Who are the users/user groups affected by the change?
* What success looks like and how will we measure it? How much is specifically related to user interface, usability, learnability, knobs and levers?
* Materials/Workflows of the existing product. Sketches or wireframes of ideas. PR/FAQ are also help.
