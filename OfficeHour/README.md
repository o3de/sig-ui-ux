# O3DE UI/UX Office Hours

The UI/UX SIG is running Office Hours every Wednesday at 11am Pacific Time. The purpose of the office hours is to provide O3DE community a place to ask for assistant or discuss concerned topics for user research, user experience design, user interface design, and visual design related to O3DE. 

**You can use office hours to:**

* Request a "sign-off" on your project from the UI/UX SIG.
* Usability/UX review of your designs/mock-ups.
* Discuss certain customer pain points or UX related topics.
* Brainstorm ideas or solutions to a user problem or feature.
* Submit user research or UX design requests.

**What to bring to the office hour:**

* A brief project overview or TDD document. A simple problem statement or project description will work too.
* Who are the users your project is designed for? Who are the users/user groups affected by the change?
* What success looks like and how will we measure it? How much is specifically related to user interface, usability, learnability, knobs and levers?
* Materials/Workflows of the existing product. Sketches or wireframes of ideas. PR/FAQ are also help.

    * It’s better to have the chance to **power up your project* you’re working on, than skip the opportunity to.
    * UI/UX SIG can normally be involved during start, middle, and end of projects
