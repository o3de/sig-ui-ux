# Special Interest Group UI & UX (SIG-UI-UX)

## Description of SIG UI-UX

The SIG-UI-UX (Special Interest Group for UI & UX) is a group of individuals who care deeply about the user experience of O3DE. The group is comprised of UX Experts, Developers, Game Artists, and an array of community contributors. Anyone, who cares about the user experience of O3DE, is welcome to join. This SIG is a crosscutting team that works alongside other SIGs to raise the bar of the engine's user experience.

## What We Do

We manage the work stream for O3DE interfaces, including new workflows and design patterns for upcoming features within O3DE. We also undertake ongoing issues or features reported through GitHub. Additionally, we spend a percentage of our time designing a systematic approach to working with users of our designs within their tools. We do this by creating and maintaining our design system, the Blue Jay Design System. Ultimately, we run and maintain a set of quality standard for O3DE, this is through the Rev the Engine program which allows us to track and set goals for the health of O3DE over many iterations.

## How to Contribute SIG UI-UX
  
As a contributor you can help in one of the following way.

-   Providing your feedback on designs as review them. As a user of O3DE your viewpoint brings another data point to the conversation. This allows the SIG UI-UX to make sure we are covering all the interactions from multiple perspectives. This helps us to learn and grow.
    
-   Our team is small and help is always welcome. So if you feel that you can help with the O3DE interfaces in any capacity let us know and we will find a good way for us to collaborate. This can be in the form of helping with research, designing, helping to write/maintain our documentation, or working on tickets.
    
-   If you are an expert in a specific area like: game engines, Internet of Things (IoT), simulations or movies, we would love your help as a research participant. We can design great things by collaborating with the experts like you. Collecting feedback direct from our users can make O3DE great.
