# Special Interest Group UI & UX (SIG UI-UX)

  

## Description of the SIG UX-UI:

The UI-UX SIG (Special Interest Group for UI and UX) is a collection of individuals who care deeply about the UX and UI experience of O3DE. It’s comprised of UX experts, developers, game artist, and an array of community contributors. Anyone who cares about user experience of O3DE is welcome to join. The UI UX SIG is a across cutting team that works with all of our other SIG programs to raise the bar of engine user experience.

  

## What the SIG UI-UX Does:

We manage the work stream for O3DE interfaces, including new workflows or design patterns for upcoming features coming from within O3DE. We also undertake ongoing issues or features reported through GitHub. We also spend a percentage of our time designing a systematic approach to working with people using our designs in their own tools. This is done by creating and maintaining our design system called the BlueJay design system where developers can build tools without UX guidance. Last but not least, we run and maintain a set of quality standard for all of O3DE interfaces over the long term. This program is called Rev the Engine and it allows us to track and set goals the health of O3DE’s interfaces over many iterations.

  

## How to Contribute SIG UI-UX
  
As a contributor you can help in one of the following way.

-   Providing your feedback on designs as review them. As a user of O3DE your viewpoint brings another data point to the conversation. This allows the SIG UI-UX to make sure we are covering all the interactions from multiple perspectives. This helps us to learn and grow.
    
-   Our team is small and help is always welcome. So if you feel that you can help with the O3DE interfaces in any capacity let us know and we will find a good way for us to collaborate. This can be in the form of helping with research, designing, helping to write/maintain our documentation, or working on tickets.
    
-   If you are an expert in a specific area like: game engines, Internet of Things (IoT), simulations or movies, we would love your help as a research participant. We can design great things by collaborating with the experts like you. Collecting feedback direct from our users can make O3DE great.
