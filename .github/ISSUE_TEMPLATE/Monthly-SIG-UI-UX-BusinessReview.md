## Monthly SIG UI-UX  Business review for XX-XX-XXXX

Hi O3DE UX Community,  
 
We want to invite you to our monthly UI-UX business review. In each of our monthly meetings, we will send out a reminder a week ahead of time, allowing UI-UX community members to propose a topic that matter the most to them. These chats might include, new designs, new patterns, research, new workflows, chats with a specialist, or even a water cooler conversation. Come join us around the virtual table and let's talk shop. Feel free to add your topic to the ticket https://github.com/o3de/sig-ui-ux/issues, and we will do our best to plan accordingly. 
 
A small side note. This meeting will be different from our open office hour meeting that is scheduled every Thursday. This monthly meeting will be used to talk about the larger picture, and what's our goal to get there. We won't be focusing on individual bugs or release issues.
