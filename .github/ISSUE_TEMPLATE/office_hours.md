## FAQ

#### How can I use the Office Hours?
- Request a "sign-off" on your project from the SIG.
- Demonstrate a review of your design or mockups.
- Discuss customer pain points or UX-related topics.
- Brainstorm ideas or solutions to a user problem or feature.
- Submit user research or design requests.

#### What should I bring to the Office Hours?
Absolutely nothing! You're not required to bring anything, but a brief overview on your project would be helpful. This could include the following:
-  A simple user problem statement. _As a user, I want to ..., because ..._
- Who is your target user? Who are the users affected by this change?
- What is your vision behind this change?
- What is your issue related to: user interface, usability testing, learnability, documentation, etc.?
- Any materials or workflows of the existing project, i.e. sketches, wireframes or prototypes.

#### I signed-up, but can no longer attend the meeting. What do I do?
If you’re unable to attend after proposing a topic, please reach out to us on the Discord #sig-ui-ux Text channel or comment on the [issue](https://github.com/o3de/sig-ui-ux/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+todays+in%3Atitle) to inform us before the meeting starts.  

#### How else can I participate in or contribute to the UI-UX community?

Great question! If you specialise in research, design, or have a unique understanding of game development, please reach out to us as we can facilitate a discussion on the best method for your contribution. There are other, less intimidating, ways you can try your hand at contributing.  

1.  You can offer to be a note-taker, we always require help in making records of our conversation.
2.  You can also offer to manage the agenda; put together items, or review items from previous meetings.
3.  You can also speak with the chairs, or other members of the SIG about working on UX issues.
