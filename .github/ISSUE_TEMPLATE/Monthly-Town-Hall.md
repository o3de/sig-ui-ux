## FAQ
#### How else can I participate in or contribute to the UI-UX community?

Great question! If you specialise in research, design, or have a unique understanding of game development, please reach out to us as we can facilitate a discussion on the best method for your contribution. There are other, less intimidating, ways you can try your hand at contributing.  

1.  You can offer to be a note-taker, we always require help in making records of our conversation.
2.  You can also offer to manage the agenda; put together items, or review items from previous meetings.
3.  You can also speak with the chairs, or other members of the SIG about working on UX issues.

#### What should I bring to the meeting?
Absolutely nothing! We require just your attendance, along with your fascinating topic of conversation.  

#### What’s the latest time that I can add a topic?
The SIG team will take a look at the ticket 24 hours prior to the scheduled meeting. At that point, we will lock down the agenda for the hour.  

#### I signed-up, but can no longer attend the meeting. What do I do?
If you’re unable to attend after proposing a topic, please reach out to us on the Discord #sig-ui-ux Text channel or comment on the [issue](https://github.com/o3de/sig-ui-ux/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+todays+in%3Atitle) to inform us before the meeting starts.
