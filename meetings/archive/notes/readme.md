# O3DE Meetings Notes Overview:

Please allow 24 to 48 hours after the meeting for our meeting notes to be updated on the system. If you have any questions related to a meeting topic, for the time being lets put those inside the ticket related to the meeting. This will ping all the respective parties to get you your answers. 

This is our current plan of record and will change as we know a better way.

Many thanks!
