Several programs that we are doing to improve the UX in O3DE

   * Rev the Engine
       - Notes to be include seperate process. Details on this progam are still in process
       - We are looking to migrate tickets from RTE to GitHub. 
        
  * UI/UX SIG Triage – Process:
    *  We are trying to figuring out how using the “Sig-UX-UI” team label would prevent contributors from pushing work out with out someone reviewing it from the UX team. More updates to come.
        * We talked about tags and which ones make sense to use as a group.
        * We tried a handful of tickets to see if the process will work. 
        * Proposed using an incentive model to promote users from the community to offer help for 03DE. Community was onboard with this direction.
           * Beginner level - 0 to 5 tickets (5 tickets).
           * Green level - 6 to 16 tickets (10 tickets).
           * Mid level - 17 to 32 tickets (15 tickets).
           * Advanced level - 33 to 53 tickets (20 tickets).
          *  Staff - 54 and above (Free Swag).
        * Showed Zenhubs process and how we intend to use it.

* No conflicting issue or blocking issue brought up by the community
