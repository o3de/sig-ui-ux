# O3DE SIG-UI-UX: Meetings

The O3DE SIGs host regular community meetings to give updates on their contribution to the project, and its overall progress. These meetings are recurring events to give the community an opportunity to make their voice heard.

You can reach out to the Open 3D Foundation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/F8jjUmpCBG) or sign up to each SIGs' [mailing list](https://lists.o3de.org/groups) to receive updates for the recurring events.

## Meetings

### Weekly Office Hour
We hold weekly Office Hours to provide the community a chance to share their ideas and get involved in the project, the time is set aside to answer questions, address issues, provide feedback, and discuss topics with the members of the community.

**Time:** every Thursday @ 09:00 PT ([Timezone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=TSC&iso=20221011T08&p1=234&ah=1))  
**Location:** [Discord SIG-UI-UX Voice Channel](https://discord.gg/Mc6jStmuMK)

### Monthly Town Hall
We also run a monthly Town Hall meeting, where we hear about topics of interest, or read the latest research findings, review designs, or discuss new patterns or upcoming plans.

**Time:** first Tuesday of every month @ 11:00 PT ([Timezone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=TSC&iso=20221011T08&p1=234&ah=1))

## Who can Attend

Everyone, regardless of membership within the SIG itself, is welcome to attend. The #sig-ui-ux channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Mc6jStmuMK) is a great place to get started. If you would like to observe the meeting proceedings, you may show up unannounced at your leisure. If you'd like to ask a question, or have an agenda item or a topic of interest to discuss, please comment in the corresponding [issue](https://github.com/o3de/sig-ui-ux/issues) posted ahead of the meeting.

O3DE cannot work without help and input from its community members, and *you don't need anyone's permission to get involved and contribute to this project*. You can also find a number of topics under the [GitHub Discussions area](https://github.com/o3de/foundation/discussions) which need your input.
