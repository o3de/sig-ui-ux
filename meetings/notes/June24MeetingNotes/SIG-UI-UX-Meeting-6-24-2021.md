Several programs that we are doing to improve the UX in O3DE
* Rev the Engine
  *  We interviewed white glove, external and internal customers and collected the major issues
  * We discovered the different stages that people come across
  * We defined 10 most common workflows to test again 
  * We created a rating system to help define the status of the workflows
  * This helped define an unbiased feedback to help evaluate the engine
  * There are two milestones. Milestone 1 is the GA release date.
  * Milestone 2 is for afterwards.
  * Includes: games jams, reassess the rates with the community and measuring Time on Task frameworks.
   * E.g. by using these assessment we have been able to improve a material workflow from 45 mins to 2 mins
  * Jeremy Ong mentioned it would be good to define a standard for these things, so other studios trying to deploy their own workflows they can cross compare too. Gavin, Jonny and yuyi to take offline.

* UI/UX Dev Library
  * UI component library is also available inside as a framework system inside O3DE. It has code snippets and API references that you can build yourself.

* With O3DE being an open source project, will the docs offer a boilerplate of what I will need to know to extend the editor for my own tools / needs?
  * The team have been working on this.
  * We are also doing editor extension assessments to identify these gaps that users could struggle in doing this
