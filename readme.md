# Special Interest Group UI & UX (SIG-UI-UX)

The SIG-UI-UX is a group of individuals who care deeply about the user experience of O3DE. The group is comprised of UX Experts, Developers, Game Artists, and an array of community contributors. Anyone, who cares about the user experience of O3DE, is welcome to join. This SIG is a crosscutting team that works alongside other SIGs to raise the bar of the engine's user experience.

## What We Do

We manage the work stream for O3DE interfaces, including new workflows and design patterns for upcoming features within O3DE. We also undertake ongoing issues or features reported through GitHub. Additionally, we spend a percentage of our time designing a systematic approach to working with users of our designs within their tools. We do this by creating and maintaining our design system, the Blue Jay Design System. Ultimately, we run and maintain a set of quality standard for O3DE, this is through the Rev the Engine program which allows us to track and set goals for the health of O3DE over many iterations.

You can learn more about our work via our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/o3de/projects/9/views/1).

## How to Contribute

As a contributor, you can help in the following ways:

- Providing feedback on designs, as we review them. As a user of O3DE, your viewpoint acts as another data point to the overall conversation. This allows the SIG to make sure all interactions are covered, from multiple perspectives, which in turn helps us to learn and grow.

- We are a small team, and always appreciate help. If you think you can help with O3DE's user experience, let us know, and we'll find a way for us to collaborate. This could be in the form of conducting research, designing, writing and/or maintaining our documentation, or working on issues.

- If you're a subject-matter expert, we would love your help as a research participant. We design great things by collaborating with experts like you. Moreover, collecting feedback directly from end-users can make O3DE great.
