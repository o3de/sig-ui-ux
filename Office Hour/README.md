# SIG-UI-UX Office Hours & Design Review

We run Office Hours every Thursday, and the purpose of doing so is to provide the O3DE Community with a time and place to meet with us to ask for assistance, or to discuss topics which require help with user research, user experience design, user interface design, and/or visual design for O3DE.

**Time:** every Thursday @ 9:00 PT ([Timezone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=TSC&iso=20221011T08&p1=234&ah=1))  
**Location:** [Discord SIG-UI-UX Voice Room](https://discord.gg/Mc6jStmuMK)  

If you're not sure of your need for our Office Hours, feel free to reach out to us on the [#sig-ui-ux](https://discord.gg/tvYZUKJK) Discord channel. We can be, typically, involved throughout the phases of your project, and it's better to have a chance to **power up** your project than skip any opportunities.

### Sign Up

You can sign up for a specific hour, and leave a comment on an issue from the [list of Office Hour issues](https://github.com/o3de/sig-ui-ux/issues).

If our schedule doesn't work for you, please submit an issue with the topic you would like to discuss, and we will find a time that works for us. 

### Agenda
This weekly meeting, typically, covers the following items:
- The UX team demonstrates in-progress workflows.
- SIG-UI-UX provides feedback to others on their feature-design work.
- An open conversation on the UI/UX issues occurring in the pipeline.

### How can I use the Office Hours?
- Request a "sign-off" on your project from the SIG.
- Demonstrate a review of your design or mockups.
- Discuss customer pain points or UX-related topics.
- Brainstorm ideas or solutions to a user problem or feature.
- Submit user research or design requests.

### What should I bring to the Office Hours?
You're not required to bring anything, but a brief overview on your project would be helpful. This could include the following:
- A simple user problem statement. _As a user, I want to ..., because ..._
- Who is your target user? Who are the users affected by this change?
- What is your vision behind this change?
- What is your issue related to: user interface, usability testing, learnability, documentation, etc.?
- Any materials or workflows of the existing project, i.e. sketches, wireframes or prototypes.
